"HTTP Hunt" Game Coding Challenge.

Your registered User Id is: <9p7rYUAQs>

In this game, you’ll have to solve series of programming challenges till you hit the finish line. But there's a bit of a twist to it. The whole game is driven by HTTP REST APIs. 

Few important guidelines:

For every API call, pass your UserID as an HTTP header with key "userId". Your userId is <9p7rYUAQs>. If you don't do this step, you will receive an "Invalid user!” error.
For every POST API call, you need to pass "content-type" as "application/json" as well.
For every API call, use the host as https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net
 So how should you start playing?

Hit an endpoint GET https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net/challenge which would give you further instructions. Please complete this “HTTP Hunt” game challenge within two days but incase you need more time, request your Recruiter for the same.
